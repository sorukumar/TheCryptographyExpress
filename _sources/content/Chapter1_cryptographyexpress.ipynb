    "# Chapter 1: Introduction to Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're passing secret notes in class. That's cryptography in a nutshell - keeping secrets secret. But instead of folding paper into fancy shapes, we use math to scramble our messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Cryptography?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is like a secret language for your digital life. It's the art of writing or solving codes to protect information. Think of it as a magical lock for your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Brief History\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ancient Egyptians used picture symbols to hide messages.\n",
    "- Julius Caesar shifted letters to confuse enemies.\n",
    "- World War II saw the rise of machine-based encryption like the Enigma.\n",
    "- Today, cryptography protects everything from your texts to your online shopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In our digital world, cryptography is everywhere:\n",
    "- It keeps your WhatsApp messages private.\n",
    "- It secures your online banking.\n",
    "- It protects your passwords when you log into websites.\n",
    "- It even makes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography has three main tools in its toolbox:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symmetric-key cryptography**: Like a secret handshake between friends.\n",
    "2. **Public-key cryptography**: Think of a magical mailbox anyone can put letters in, but only you can open.\n",
    "3. **Hash functions**: Imagine a paper shredder that always makes the same confetti pattern for the same document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Learned\n",
    "- Cryptography is about keeping information secret and secure.\n",
    "- It has a long history, from ancient civilizations to modern digital systems.\n",
    "- Cryptography is crucial in our daily digital interactions.\n",
    "- There are three main types of cryptographic tools: symmetric-key, public-key, and hash functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Check: Did You Get It?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if you caught the main ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What's the secret language of computers called? (Hint: It starts with 'C')\n",
    "2. What do we call the key that both sender and receiver share? (Hint: It sounds like 'symmetric')\n",
    "3. What's the digital equivalent of a fingerprint? (Hint: It starts with 'H')\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about your answers, then check below!\n",

    "<summary>Click to see the answers</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cryptography\n",
    "2. Symmetric key\n",
    "3. Hash function\n",
