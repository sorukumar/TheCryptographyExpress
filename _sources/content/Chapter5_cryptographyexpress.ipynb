    "# Chapter 5: Cryptography in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered the building blocks of cryptography, let's see how they're used in the real world. Cryptography isn't just about keeping secrets; it's about ensuring trust, authenticity, and integrity in our digital lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Digital Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital signatures are like electronic fingerprints. They allow you to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. Here's how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sender creates a hash of the message.\n",
    "2. The sender encrypts the hash with their private key, creating a digital signature.\n",
    "3. The receiver decrypts the signature using the sender's public key.\n",
    "4. The receiver also hashes the received message.\n",
    "5. If the decrypted hash matches the newly computed hash, the signature is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensures that the message is from the claimed sender and hasn't been altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Exchange Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "Key exchange protocols solve a fundamental problem: how do two parties agree on a shared secret key over an insecure channel? The most famous of these is the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Diffie-Hellman works, intuitively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice and Bob agree on a public color, say yellow.\n",
    "2. They each choose a secret color (red for Alice, blue for Bob).\n",
    "3. They mix their secret color with the public yellow.\n",
    "4. They exchange these mixed colors.\n",
    "5. They each mix their secret color with the received mixed color.\n",
    "6. They end up with the same final color, which no eavesdropper can determine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement a simple version of Diffie-Hellman:"
