    "# Chapter 3: Public-key Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a magical mailbox. Anyone can put a letter in it, but only you can open it and read the messages. That's the basic idea behind public-key cryptography!\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Public-key Cryptography Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You create two keys: a public key (like your mailbox) and a private key (like your mailbox key).\n",
    "2. You share your public key with everyone. It's like leaving your mailbox out in the open.\n",
    "3. Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message for you (like putting a letter in your mailbox).\n",
    "4. Only you, with your private key, can decrypt and read these messages (like opening your mailbox).\n",
    "\n",
    "It solves the big problem of symmetric encryption: how to securely share the key. With public-key cryptography, you don't need to share any secret key!\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Simple Example: RSA\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most famous public-key systems is RSA (named after its inventors: Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman). Here's a simplified version of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose two prime numbers (let's call them p and q).\n",
    "2. Multiply them to get n (n = p * q).\n",
    "3. Choose a public exponent e.\n",
    "4. Calculate a private exponent d.\n",
    "5. Your public key is (n, e), and your private key is (n, d).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a simple (but not secure) implementation:"

    "Pros:\n",
    "1. Solves the key distribution problem of symmetric encryption.\n",

    "1. Much slower than symmetric encryption.\n",
    "2. Requires longer key lengths for equivalent security.\n",
    "3. More computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-world Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Secure websites (HTTPS) use public-key cryptography to establish a secure connection.\n",
    "2. Secure email systems like PGP use public-key cryptography.\n",
    "3. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use public-key cryptography for digital signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Learned\n",
    "- Public-key cryptography uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.\n",
    "- It's like a magical mailbox that anyone can put messages into, but only you can open.\n",
    "- RSA is a famous public-key algorithm.\n",
    "- Digital signatures are possible with public-key cryptography.\n",
    "- It solves the key distribution problem but is slower than symmetric encryption.\n",

    "2. What's the name of the famous public-key algorithm we discussed? (Hint: It's three letters)\n",
    "3. What do we call the math-based equivalent of a handwritten signature? (Hint: It starts with 'Digital')\n",
